## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries

### What I learned

- Add a line through a word with CSS :

```css
.word {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
```

- Create breakpoints with media queries for a (kind of) responsive design :

```css
@media (max-width: 1200px) {
  main.card {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

### Useful resources

[Josh Comeau's CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This helped me better understand CSS resets. I plan on using parts of his reset and modify it over time with my experience.
